#T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(TSNE)

T-SNE is a tool to visualize high-dimensional data. It converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embeddings and the high dimension data.

Other dimension rediction methods are:

- PCA for dense data
- TruncatedSVD for sparse data.
